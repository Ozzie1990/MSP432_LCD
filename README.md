# MSP432_LCD_EXAMPLE
This example code is to get started using an LCD screen with the Texas Instrument MSP432 Launch Pad. 
Personally I enjoy using TI microcontroller since they have good example code, are well document and getting started is easy.
If your looking to move on beyond Arduino I highly recommend them.  I was looking for ARM based system to play around with
and came across the MSP432 Launch Pad, which uses a lower power ARM Cortex M4F MCU @ 48MHz.  What really caught my eye is
the price, only $13 (not including shipping).  But even still that's a good price a dev board.

This read me isn't how to get started with the MSP432, maybe I'd do that another day, but it's a simple example code to start
working with an LCD screen that I bought on Adafruit.  Links below.  I love Adafruit for there cheap and easy to use design 
boards but I don't enjoy that many development libraries are focused on Arduino.  While Arduino's are great they're very
limiting in what you can do and don't give you a real sense of how complicated a simple thing like enabling a 
GPIO pin is.  Knowing these things are important for anyone looking to have a job in the field of embedded design or if
you want to do more complex things.

That's why I'm sharing this code.  Fair warning, I'm no expert in C coding.  I'm sure they're are litle ways to optimize this 
code and when I come back to this project I likely will optimize certain things.  Some quick notes:

-The gpio_support.c file is mostly ripped from the ti code gpio.c.  There are some minor differences and I've added my own 
wording that I find easier to read.
-The code isn't complete, there are other functions I can add that do various other things and initializations.  I will get 
to them at some point but if you can read the code and understand what is going on you can easily add them yourself.  Just
look at the datasheet.
-Follow the wiring guide for the LCD screen from Adafruit.  See link.
-You'll need a pot resistor (see same link that is in the wiring guide)
-I will add a schematic at some point to show how the wiring can be done and might make a PCB file in EAGLE to interface
with the LCD screen and launch pad board
-This code uses a 4 bit output mode rather than 8 bit.  Slightly more complicated timing requirements and takes more time to 
write to the screen but it's an LCD screen.  You shouldn't need to write to it that fast anyway.
